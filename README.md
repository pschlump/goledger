Command line accounting
=======================

Based on tn47/goledger.  The original no longer compiled or passed tests because a dependent package no longer existed.  Replace the
dependent package and added additional tests.

Inspired by [ledger-cli](http://ledger-cli), goledger is a re-write of command
line ledger in golang, with the stated goals.

* Keeping it command line friendly, whether or not GUI / web interface are available.
* Defaults to Locale en_IN, until the tool becomes smart enough to handle locale specific details automatically.
* Targeted for personal, small and medium enterprises.
* Keep to the spirit of ledger-cli as much as possible.

Basic Concepts
==============

* ``Credit the giver debit the receiver``.
* ``Commodity``, based accounting, where currency is also a commodity.
* ``Account``, holding one or more commodities.
* ``Posting``, commodities can be posted to an account. Posting can be
debit posting or credit posting, based on whether the account is the
source account (credit the giver) or target account (debit the receiver)
* ``Transaction``, involving 2 or more postings, where the sum of credit
postings should balance out the sum of debit postings.

Once comfortable with above concepts, we can start book-keeping with ledger.

Transactions and Directives
===========================

Book-keeping starts with the journal file, typically ending with ``.ldg``. A
ledger file can contain directives (sometimes called as declarations) or
transaction entries.

There can be any number of directives and any number of transaction entries.

Transactions have the following format:

```text
2011/03/15   Whole Food Market
    Expenses:Groceries   75.00
    Assets:Checking      -75
```

**line1**: Date and Payee  
**line2**: Accountname, Amount  
**line3**: Accountname, Amount  

* Each transaction is associated with a date, and it is always advised to
enter transaction with older date before and newer date after.
* Payee gives a name to the transaction, other than that no special
meaning is attached to it.
* Posting with positive amount are treated as debit transaction, and the
posting's account is called target account.
* Posting with negative amount are treated as credit transaction, and the
posting's account is called source account.

To begin with, ledger tool expects one or more journal files to process.
As mentioned earlier, a journal file typically contains directives and
transactions. The format of journal file is plain text.

```bash
$ goledger -f journal.ldg
```

To process more than one journal files, supply them as
``-f journal1.ldg,journal2.lsg``. Even if the journals are not in time order
or transactions within a journal file is not in time order, goledger will
sort them in time order before applying them.

**Including journal files**

If several journal files need to be processed, it is easier to create a new
file and include other journal files within. For example consolidate.ldg
can have:

```
include journal1.ldg
include journal2.ldg
```

**Account-name**

There are some conventions used in account naming. Account names can be
composed of any character except:

* Double spaces and tabs
* Mathematical and logical operators: ``-+*/^&|=``
* Bracketing characters: ``<>[](){}``
* The at symbol: ``@``
* semicolon: ``;``

**Commodity-name**

Commodity can appear before or after the amount, and may or may not be separated
from it by a space. Most characters are allowed in a commodity name, except
for the following:

* Any kind of white-space
* Numerical digits
* Punctuation: ``.,;:?!``
* Mathematical and logical operators: ``-+*/^&|=``
* Bracketing characters: ``<>[](){}``
* The at symbol: ``@``

Standards, conventions and views
--------------------------------

While the basic concept of accounting is not more that what is stated
above, there are endless variations stipulated by accounting standards
and conventions. Sometimes we may need different view of accounts for the
same set of transactions. For example, let us take accrual accounting:

**Accrual accounting**

Cash (or commodities) are physical and to get a __realistic__ picture of
our accounts we book transactions that has already taken place
physically. Now, we will look at three different scenarios demanding
three different flavours of __realism__.

**Scenario1: Income Tax filing**

At least in India income tax department expects us to accrue all interest
that are receivable on Bank deposits, as income, and pay tax. Although we
might not have received the interest until the deposit matures. How to
book this in goledger:

```text
2016/Jun/21  FD savings ; Deposit for 1 year
    Asset:FD                        10000
    Asset:CurrentAccount

2017/Mar/31  Accrued interest on Bank FD
    Income:Interest:Receivable       800
    Income:FD-Interest

2017/Jun/22  FD Matures
    Asset:CurrentAccount            11000
    Income:Interest:Receivable       -800
    Income:FD-Interest               -200
    Asset:FD                       -10000
```

**Scenario2: Distress sale of company**

When a company is under distress and a valuation is to be done to attract
potential buyers, it is normally expected that buyer would ask us to
discount Receivables but include Payables.

**Scenario3: Brokerage houses**

If book keeping is done for a brokerage house, which buy commodity and sell
them later, most often the actual payment will be deferred until actual sale
has happened. For them, accrual accounting might have to be totally skipped
while generating a report on operating-cost.

As evident in above case, such variations are endless and hence, goledger
doesn't try to be smart about them. Just ``Credit the giver and debit the
receiver``. If a particular feature or a nicety is required in booking
a transaction or in generating a report, please file an issue and let us
see whether or how to take it forward.

Ledger commands
===============

**Balance**

The primary objective of consolidating all transactions is to make sure that
all debits and all credits balance out each other. So there is a ``balance``
command.

```bash
$ goledger -f journal.ldg balance
```

It is also possible to filter out accounts listed in a balance report, for
instance the below command will list only accounts containing ``Asset:``:

```bash
$ goledger -f journal.ldg balance Asset:
```

**Passbook**

A passbook implies transaction between one account, let us call this as
third party account, and all other accounts. The third party many not be
interested in all the other accounts, from his/her point of view the contra
posting in a transaction to all the other accounts are irrelevant. In such
cases we can generate a passbook and give it to them:

```bash
$ goledger -f journal.ldg passbook John
```

``John`` is the third party for whom the passbook is generated.

**equity**

One way to organize journal file add all transactions in the same file year
after year. But this can quickly get large and can become messy, it can also
take goledger more time to process all the entries. To avoid this, we can
split journals into separate files one for each financial-year. For this,
``equity`` can be very handy, which can report the year end balance as a
transaction for next year's ``Opening balance``.

```bash
goledger -f journal-2015.ldg equity > journal-2016.ldg
```

Now this come with the cost of information loss, that is, while processing
the journal file for 2016, ``journal-2016.ldg`` goledger can't generate
interesting reports from earlier transactions. To work around this:

```bash
goledger -f journal-2015.ldg,journal-2016.ldg -stitch register
```

use the ``-stitch`` that can skip all transactions with Payee as ``Opening
balance``.

Getting Started
===============

There are plans to package ledger for different platforms, like windows,
ubuntu, mac, raspberry-pi, debian etc.. Until then, goledger can be
obtained via golang-tools. For mac or linux users,
[install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install), and:

```bash
$ go get github.com/pschlump/goledger
$ cd pschlump/goledger
$ make test # sanity test.
$ make install
```

It is surprisingly easy!!

Gotchas
=======

* Account name should start with at least 2 character
* Hard spaces (2 or more consecutive spaces or a single tab-space) have
special meaning in ledger format. So avoid them in account names.

Ledger-likes
============

* [ledger rewrite in haskell](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger)
* [ledger rewrite on JVM](https://github.com/sn127/tackler)
* [ledger rewrite in scala](https://github.com/hrj/abandon)
* [ledger-cli](https://github.com/ledger), it is worth spending time reading
upon the ledger specification.

How to contribute
=================

* Pick an issue, or create an new issue. Provide adequate documentation for the issue.
* Assign the issue or get it assigned.
* Work on the code, once finished, raise a pull request.
* Goledger is written in [golang](https://golang.org/), hence expected to follow the global guidelines for writing go programs.
* If the changeset is more than few lines, please generate a
[report card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/pschlump/goledger).

Happy Accounting !!
